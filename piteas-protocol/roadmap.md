# ðŸ›£ Roadmap

## Our Mission

1. Continually optimize our advanced routing whilst tactically aggregating liquidity to make sure we offer the best swaps to our users
2. Remain vigilant on-chain to make sure we place our future efforts where we can attract the most volume. (For example, expanding to a chain that is in need of an aggregator or simply expand to a chain where we know we could do a better job than existing offerings).
3. Build strong relationships with like-minded projects and support them with the integration of the Piteas routes so they can pass the incredible savings our protocol provides directly to their users
