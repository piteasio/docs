As you know, Piteas aggregates liquidity from multiple DEXs, enabling you to swap at the best rate. Following the protocol's launch, it did not charge any swap fees for a little over a month, and subsequently introduced the new fee model. The protocol assesses how much better our best offer is compared to the next best offer, ensuring we maintain our commitment to delivering the best price on the network, and charges a portion of the savings as protocol revenue. Our priority is the widespread adoption and usage of the protocol.

The second revenue model is positive slippage. This represents the profit generated from the change in liquidity on the network until the swap transaction is confirmed, which positively affects the output amount.
