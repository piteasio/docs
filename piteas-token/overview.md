# ðŸ’  Overview

{% hint style="danger" %}
Piteas has no any governance or utility tokens yet! Please beware of scammers.

**This content is currently in draft mode and being updated.**
{% endhint %}

Piteas is a project that generates revenue and has its own economic model. To strengthen the protocol, empower the community in decision-making, and manage the economy generated from the revenue, it will have a utility token that serves as governance and utility tool.

The PTS Token, which will serve as the governance and utility token for Piteas, is designed to have limited supply and be resistant to manipulations.

### Token Details:

### So, how does Piteas generate revenue?

As you know, Piteas aggregates liquidity from multiple DEXs, enabling you to swap at the best rate. Following the protocol's launch, it did not charge any swap fees for a little over a month, and subsequently introduced the new fee model. The protocol assesses how much better our best offer is compared to the next best offer, ensuring we maintain our commitment to delivering the best price on the network, and charges a portion of the savings as protocol revenue. Our priority is the widespread adoption and usage of the protocol.

The second revenue model is positive slippage. This represents the profit generated from the change in liquidity on the network until the swap transaction is confirmed, which positively affects the output amount.

_We are continuing the development process to create new use cases for PTS Token and provide privileges for token holders._
