Please read these Terms of Use (these “Terms”) carefully as they govern your use of the Service.

1. You acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these terms, which incorporates by this reference, any other policies or guidelines posted on docs.piteas.io/policies/terms-of-service (the “site”, and such policies and guidelines collectively, the “additional policies”);
2. If you will be using the service on behalf of any entity or person other than yourself, you represent that you have the authority to enter into these terms, on behalf of such entity or other person, and to bind such entity or other person to these terms; and
3. You represent and warrant that your use (including, if applicable, your use on behalf of any entity or other person) of the service will not violate any applicable laws and you (including, if applicable, the entity or other person on whose behalf you will be using the service) complies with the conditions of use set forth in section 2 below.

If you do not agree to all of these terms or you do not have the necessary authority to accept these terms on behalf of the entity or other person with respect to whom you will be using the service, you should not accept these terms and you may not use the service. Any use of the service that does not comply with these terms is unauthorized and unlawful.

### 1. Service[​](https://docs.odos.xyz/resources/policies/terms-of-use#1-service) <a href="#id-1-service" id="id-1-service"></a>

1.1. Piteas DAO, develops, operates and provides its proprietary online application known as, “Piteas”, including application programming interfaces (collectively, “Piteas Service”, “Piteas”, or “Service”), that enables you to exchange or trade (“Swap”) Tokens in your digital wallet (“Wallet”) for other Tokens at the best Token prices or rates on select blockchains. You can see the full list of blockchains for which the Service currently supports Token Swaps here https://app.piteas.io

1.2. Piteas DAO does not possess or hold any of your Tokens at any time but solely provides an aggregator Service that allows you to view the best rates for Token Swaps on certain third party cryptocurrency decentralized exchanges (each, a “Third Party Decentralized Exchange” or “Third Party DEX”).

1.3. When you click “Swap”, you are using the Service to place an order for Swapping your Tokens into other Tokens and the order is then executed by the applicable Third Party DEXs (each, executed Swap, a “Transaction”). You can see the full list of Third Party DEXs the Service currently connects with here https://app.piteas.io

1.4. To use the Service, you will need to connect your digital wallet (“Wallet”) to the Service. You may, at any time, log off your Wallet from the Service. While Piteas DAO uses reasonable measures to protect the security and integrity of the Service and Site, you are solely responsible for ensuring the security of your Wallet (such as, but not limited to, keeping your Wallet locked when not in use). You can see the full list of third party Wallet solutions that you may use with the Service here https://app.piteas.io

1.5. The price indicated in the “To” field for the Swap is the price of the Swap at the time you initiate an order for the Swap (“Expected Price”). You understand that due to the volatility of trading cryptocurrencies in the period of time between placing an order for, and executing, that Swap, the price at which the Swap is executed (“Executed Price”) may not be the same as the Expected Price. Piteas DAO does not control the difference between the Expected Price and the Executed Price of any Transaction (“Slippage”). However, the Service dashboard shows you a “Minimum Received” field which is the price below which your Swap order will not be authorized to be executed.

1.6. You acknowledge and agree that Piteas DAO may collect Positive Slippage (as defined below), if any, on each Transaction as consideration for providing the Service. You also acknowledge and agree to pay any fees charged by third parties for each completed Swap, including Third Party DEX fees and “gas” charges. “Positive Slippage” means, with respect to a Transaction, the difference between the Expected Price and the Executed Price when the Executed Price is lower than the Expected Price for that Transaction.

1.7. You acknowledge and agree that Piteas DAO collects a fee for some services, including multi-token swaps.

1.8. You understand that the Service does not facilitate the storage or sending of any fiat currency.
