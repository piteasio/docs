# ðŸ’¸ Revenue Model & Fees

### How does Piteas generate revenue?

Piteas aggregates liquidity from multiple DEXs, enabling you to swap at the best rate. The protocol assesses how much better our best offer is compared to the next best offer, ensuring we maintain our commitment to delivering the best price on the network, and charges a portion of the savings as protocol revenue. Our priority is the widespread adoption and usage of the protocol.

Our protocolâ€™s revenue model has to follow two main lines: first, making sure the user gets a good quote, and second, ensuring the protocol earns its fair share. The golden rule is to never manipulate the quote sent through the APIâ€”the user always trades at the price shown in the interface or returned by the API. Protocol revenue is never added on top; itâ€™s already included. In rare cases, on exotic routes or unusual transaction types, the protocol may generate unexpected revenue. But even then, itâ€™s baked into the quote the user sees, and to avoid risky trades, the protocol caps that unexpected revenue to protect the user. On standard routes, it usually doesnâ€™t charge a fee at all. One key point to know is that this fee model is dynamic and configured periodically. The fine balance is to both deliver the best quotes to users and generate revenue. With all that in mind, as of September 2025, across 2.8 million lifetime swaps, our protocol has charged an average fee of 0.12%.

To find the offer of other dex protocols, Piteas runs a secondary pathfinder internally and conducts a direct path search by disabling trade splitting features. This means it always gets an offer by utilizing the multi-hop feature, which is expected to result in an offer better than, at worst, the best offer from any individual dex.

The second revenue model is positive slippage. This represents the profit generated from the change in liquidity on the network until the swap transaction is confirmed, which positively affects the output amount.

### **Use of Revenue**

Tokens bought back are transferred to the **PTS Treasury Wallet** and will be used for staking or other incentive mechanisms. For now, all buyback operations are fully managed by the team. However, in the future, the plan is to have these executed by AI agents in a non-periodic and unpredictable manner.

At least 50% of protocol revenue is used/will be used as token utility.
